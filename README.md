# NoAdver
Automated advertisement blocking for minecraft servers.

## How does it work.
When people chat on minecraft. This plugin will do the following. First off all it scans the message for url's.
In case it found an url it will do the following with it:
- Check if their is a minecraft server running on it.
- In case it can't find a minecraft server. It will check if the url is an website hosted by enjin.
- As last we open the webpage and quickly scan for minecraft server IP's in their.

## On what Minecraft API's will this work?
